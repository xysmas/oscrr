# Toll House Chocolate Chip Recipe (in grams!)

### Notes

A newfound love of my kitchen scale led me to experiment with remaking this classic recipe in grams. After all, 2.25 cups of flour can vary in weight quite a bit...

### Ingredients (sans nuts)

- 360 g flour
- 1 tsp. (4.6 g) baking soda
- 1 tsp. (6 g) table salt
- 220 g unsalted butter
- 150 g granulated sugar
- 165 g brown sugar
- 1 tsp. (5 mL) vanilla extract
- 2 large (~100 g) eggs
- 340 g chocolate chips


### Instructions
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 C)
1. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl and set aside.
2. Lightly melt or soften butter
4. Beat butter, sugars, vanilla together. 
  - Beat in eggs after the buttery mix is made, one at a time
5. Mix flour, salt, and baking soda in a separate bowl
6. Slowly mix in dry ingredients to the buttery mix
7. Mix in the chocolate chips
8. Form cookies into balls and place on the baking sheet
9. Bake the cookies 9-11 minutes or until the edges of the cookies begin to turn golden brown.

## Modifications

- Less flour will make the cookies a bit more chewy. You can probably remove up to 60g flour without destroying your cookies.
- Double or triple the volume of vanilla. Just do it. Don't ask.
- Increase brown sugar ratio to white sugar slightly for a richer taste
